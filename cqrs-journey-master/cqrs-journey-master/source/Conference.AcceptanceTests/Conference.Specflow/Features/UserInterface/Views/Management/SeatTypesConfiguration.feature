	In order to create or update a Seat Type
	As a Business Customer
	I want to be able to create or update a Seat Type and set its properties


Scenario: Seat Types are created and assigned to an existing Conference
Given an existing unpublished conference with this information
| Owner         | Email                | Name      | Description                                   | Slug   | Start      | End        |
