Feature: Self-Registrant scenarios for making a Registration for a Conference site where multiple Registrants make simultaneous reservations
	In order to reserve Seats for a Conference
	As an Attendee
	I want to be able to select an Order Item from one or many of the available where other Registrants may also be interested

#General preconditions for all the scenarios
Background: 
	Given the list of the available Order Items for the CQRS summit 2012 conference
	| seat type     | rate | quota |
	| CQRS Workshop | $500 | 10    |


@NoWatiN
Scenario: Many Registrants try to reserve the same Order Item and not all of them get the registration	
	When 20 Registrants select these Order Items
	| seat type     | quantity |
	| CQRS Workshop | 1        |
	Then only 10 Registrants get confirmed registrations for the selected Order Items
