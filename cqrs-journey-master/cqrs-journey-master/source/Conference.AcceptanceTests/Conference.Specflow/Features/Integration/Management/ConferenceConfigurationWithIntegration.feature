Feature:  Conference configuration scenarios for creating and editing Conference settings with events and commands
	In order to create or update a Conference configuration
	As a Business Customer
	I want to be able to create or update a Conference and set its properties

Background: 
Given this conference information
	| Owner         | Email                | Name      | Description                             | Slug   | Start      | End        |
	| William Flash | william@fabrikam.com | CQRS2012P | CQRS summit 2012 conference (Published) | random | 05/02/2012 | 05/12/2012 |

Scenario: A new Conference is created and published
	When the conference is created
	And the conference is published
	#ConferenceCreated
	Then the event for publishing the conference is emitted
	#ConferencePublished
	And the event for publishing the conference is emitted

Scenario: Adding Seats to an existing conference
	Given the conference already exists
	And the conference is published
	When these Seat Types are created
	| seat type                 | rate | quota |
	| General admission         | $199 | 100   |
	| CQRS Workshop             | $500 | 100   |
	| Additional cocktail party | $50  | 100   |
	#SeatCreated 
	Then the events for creating the Seat Type are emitted
