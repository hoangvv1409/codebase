# Chapter 8: Epilogue: Lessons Learned 

_How good was our map? Where did we get to? What did we learn? Did we get lost?_

> "This land may be profitable to those that will adventure it." Henry Hudson

This chapter summarizes the findings from our journey. It highlights 
what we feel were the most significant lessons we learned along the way, 
suggests some things we would do differently if we were embarking on the 
journey with our newfound knowledge, and points out some future paths 
for the Contoso Conference Management System. 

You should bear in mind that this summary reflects our specific journey; 
not all of these findings will necessarily apply to your own CQRS 
journeys. For example, one of our goals was to explore how to implement 
the CQRS pattern in an application that is deployed to Windows Azure and 
that makes use of the scalability and reliability of the cloud. For our 
project, this meant using messaging to enable multiple role types and 
instances to communicate with each other. It may be that your project 
does not require multiple role instances or is not deployed to the cloud 
and therefore may not need to use messaging so extensively (or at all). 

We hope these findings do prove useful, especially if you are just 
starting out with CQRS and event sourcing. 

# What did we Learn?

This section describes the key lessons we learned. They are not 
presented in any particular order. 

## Performance matters

At the start of our journey, one of our understandings about the CQRS 
pattern was that by separating the read and write sides of the 
application we could optimize each for performance. This perspective is 
shared by many in the CQRS community, for example: 

> "CQRS taught me that I can optimize reads and writes separately and 
> I don't have to manually denormalize into flat tables all the time."  
> Kelly Sommers

This was borne out in practice during our journey and we benefited 
significantly from this separation when we did need to solve a 
performance issue. 

During the last stage of our journey, testing revealed a set of 
performance issues in our application. When we investigated them, it 
turned out they had less to do with the way we had implemented the CQRS 
pattern and more to do with the way we were using our infrastructure. 
Discovering the root cause of these problems was the hard part; with so 
many moving parts in the application, getting the right tracing and the 
right data for analysis was the challenge. Once we identified the 
bottlenecks, fixing them turned out to be relatively easy, largely 
because of the way the CQRS pattern enables you to clearly separate 
different elements of the system, such as reads and writes. Although the 
separation of concerns that results from implementing the CQRS pattern 
can make it harder to identify an issue, once you have identified one, 
it is not only easier to fix, but also easier to prevent its return. The 
decoupled architecture makes it simpler to write unit tests that 
reproduce issues. 

The challenges we encountered in tackling the performance issues in the 
system had more to do with the fact that our system is a distributed, 
message-based system than the fact that it implements the CQRS pattern. 

Chapter 7, "[Adding Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]" 
provides more information about the ways we addressed the performance 
issues in the system and makes some suggestions about additional changes 
that we would like to make, but didn't have time to implement. 

## Implementing a message-driven system is far from simple

Our approach to infrastructure on this project was to develop it as 
needed during the journey. We didn't anticipate (and had no forewarning 
of) how much time and effort we would need to create the robust 
infrastructure that our application required. We spent at least twice as 
much time as we originally planned on many development tasks because we 
continued to uncover additional infrastructure-related requirements. In 
particular, we learned that having a robust event store from the 
beginning is essential. Another key idea we took away from the 
experience is that all I/O on the message bus should be asynchronous. 

> **JanaPersona:** Although our event store is not production-ready, the
> current implementation gives a good indication of the type of issues
> you should address if you decide to implement your own event store.

Although our application is not large, it illustrated clearly to us the 
importance of having end-to-end tracing available, and the value of 
tools that help us understand all of the message flows in the system. 
Chapter 4, "[Extending and Enhancing the Orders and Registrations 
Bounded Context][j_chapter4]," describes the value of tests in helping 
us understand the system, and discusses the messaging intermediate 
language (MIL) created by Josh Elster, one of our advisors. 

> **GaryPersona:** It would also help if we had a standard notation for
> messaging that would help us communicate some of the issues with the
> domain experts and people outside of the core team.

In summary, many of the issues we met along the way were not related 
specifically to the CQRS pattern, but were more related to the 
distributed, message-driven nature of our solution.

## The cloud has challenges

Although the cloud provides many benefits, such as reliable, scalable, off-the-shelf services that you can provision with just a few mouse clicks, cloud environments also introduce some challenges: 

* You may not be able to use transactions everywhere you want them
  because the distributed nature of the cloud makes ACID (atomicity,
  consistency, isolation, durability) transactions impractical in many
  scenarios. Therefore, you need to understand how to work with eventual
  consistency. For examples, see Chapter 5, 
  "[Preparing for the V1 Release][j_chapter5]," and the section _Options
  to reduce the delay in the UI_ in chapter 7, "[Adding Resilience and
  Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]."
* You may want to re-examine your assumptions about how to organize your
  application into different tiers. For example, see the discussion
  around in-process, synchronous commands in Chapter 7, "[Adding
  Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]."
* You must take into account not only the latency between the browser or
  on-premises environment and the cloud, but also the latency between
  the different parts of your system that are running in the cloud.
* You must take into account transient errors and be aware of how
  different cloud services might implement throttling. If your
  application uses several cloud services that might be throttled, you
  must coordinate how your application handles being throttled by
  different services at different times.

> includes a discussion of the **SynchronousCommandBusDecorator** class.

A complex cloud environment can make it harder to run quick tests during 
development. A local test environment may not mimic the behavior of the 
cloud exactly, especially with respect to performance and throttling.

## CQRS is different

At the start of our journey we were warned that although the CQRS 
pattern appears to be simple, in practice it requires a significant 
shift in the way you think about many aspects of the project. Again, 
this was borne out by our experiences during the journey. You must be 
prepared to throw away many assumptions and preconceived ideas, and you 
will probably need to implement the CQRS pattern in several bounded 
contexts before you begin to fully understand the benefits you can 
derive from the pattern. 

An example of this is the concept of eventual consistency. If you come 
from a relational database background and are accustomed to the ACID properties of 
transactions, then embracing eventual consistency and understanding its 
implications at all levels in the system is a big step to take. Chapter 
5 "[Preparing for the V1 Release][j_chapter5]," and chapter 7 "[Adding 
Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]," both discuss 
eventual consistency in different areas of the system. 

In addition to being different from what you might be familiar with, 
there is also no single correct way to implement the CQRS pattern. We 
made more false starts on pieces of funcionality and estimated poorly 
how long things would take due to our unfamiliarity with the pattern and 
approach. As we become more comfortable with the approach, we hope to 
become faster at identifiying how to implement the pattern in 
specific circumstances and improve the accuracy of our estimates. 

> **MarkusPersona:** The CQRS pattern is conceptually simple; the devil
> is in the details.

Another situation in which we took some time to understand the CQRS approach 
and its implications was during the integration between our bounded 
contexts. Chapter 5 "[Preparing for the V1 Release][j_chapter5]," 
includes a detailed discussion of how the team approached the 
integration issue between the Conference Management and the Orders and 
Registrations bounded contexts. This part of the journey uncovered some 
addtional complexity that relates to the level of coupling between 
bounded contexts when you use events as the integration mechanism. Our 
assumption that events should only contain information about the change 
in the aggregate or the bounded context proved to be unhelpful; events 
can contain additional information that is useful to one or more subscribers and 
helps to reduce the amount of work that a subscriber must perform. 

The CQRS pattern introduces additional considerations for how to 
partition your system. Not only do you need to consider how to partition 
your system into tiers, but also how to partition your system into 
bounded contexts, some of which will contain implementations of the CQRS 
pattern. We revised some of our assumptions about tiers in the last 
stage of our journey, bringing some processing into our web roles from 
the worker role where it was originally done. This is described in 
Chapter 7, "[Adding Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]" 
in the section that discusses moving some command processing in-process. 
Partitioning the system into bounded contexts should be done based on 
your domain model: each bounded context has its own domain model and 
ubiquitous language. Once you have identified your bounded contexts, you 
can then identify in which bounded contexts to implement the CQRS 
pattern. This affects how and where you need to implement integration 
between these isolated bounded contexts. Chapter 2, "[Decomposing the 
Domain][j_chapter2]," introduces our decisions for the Contoso 
Conference Management System. 

**GaryPersona:** A single process (role instance in our deployment) can 
host multiple bounded contexts. In this scenario, you don't necessarily 
need to use a service bus for the bounded contexts to communicate with each 
other. 

Implementing the CQRS pattern is more complex than implementing a 
traditional (create, read, update, delete) CRUD-style system. For this project, there was also the overhead of learning about CQRS for the first time, and creating a distributed, asynchronous messaging infrastructure. Our experiences during the journey have 
clearly confirmed to us why the CQRS pattern is not a top-level 
architecture. You must be sure that the costs associated with 
implementing a CQRS-based bounded context with this level of complexity 
are worth it; in general, it is in high-contention, collaborative 
domains that you will see the benefits of the CQRS pattern.

> infrastructure elements such as message buses and event stores.

## Event sourcing and transaction logging

We had some debate about whether or not event sourcing and transaction 
logging amount to the same thing: they both create a record of what 
happened, and they both enable you to recreate the state of your system 
by replaying the historical data. The conclusion was that the 
distinguishing feature is that events capture intent in addition to 
recording the facts of what happened. For more detail on what we mean by 
intent, see Chapter 4, "[A CQRS and ES Deep Dive][r_chapter4]",in the 
Reference Guide. 

## Involving the domain expert

Implementing the CQRS pattern encourages involvement of the domain 
expert. The pattern enables you to separate out the domain on the 
write side and the reporting requirements on the read side and to 
separate these from infrastructure concerns. This separation makes it 
easier to involve the domain expert in those aspects of the system where 
his expertise is most valuable. The use of domain-driven design concepts 
such as bounded contexts and the ubiquitous language also help to focus 
the team and to foster clear communication with the domain expert. 

Our acceptance tests proved to be an effective way to involve the domain 
expert and capture his knowledge. Chapter 4 "[Extending and Enhancing 
the Orders and Registrations Bounded Context][j_chapter4]," describes 
this tesing approach in detail. 

> **JanaPersona:** As a side-effect, these acceptance tests also
> contributed to our ability to handle our pseudo-production releases
> quickly because they enabled us to run a full set of tests at the UI
> level to verify the behavior of the system in addition to the unit and
> integration tests.

In addition to helping the team define the functional requirements of 
the system, the domain expert should also be involved in evaluating the 
trade-offs between consistency, availability, durability, and costs. For 
example, the domain expert should help to identify when a manual 
process is acceptable and what level of consistency is required in 
different areas of the system. 

> **GaryPersona:** Developers have a tendency to try to lock everything
> down to transactions to guarantee full consistency, but sometimes it's
> just not worth the effort.

## When to use CQRS

Now that we are at the end of our journey, we can suggest some of the criteria you should 
evaluate to determine whether or not you should consisder implementing 
the CQRS pattern in one or more bounded contexts in your application. 
The more of these questions you can answer positively, the more likely 
it is that applying the CQRS pattern to a given bounded context will benefit your solution: 

* Does the bounded context implement an area of
  business functionality that is a key differentiator in your market?
* Is the bounded context collaborative in nature with elements that are
  likely to have high levels of contention at run time? In other words, 
  do multiple users compete for access to the same resources?
* Is the bounded context likely to experience ever-changing business
  rules?
* Do you have a robust, scalable messaging and persistence
  infrastructure already in place?
* Is scalability one of the challenges facing this bounded context?
* Is the business logic in the bounded context complex?
* Are you clear about the benefits that the CQRS pattern will bring to
  this bounded context?
  
**GaryPersona:** These are rules of thumb, not hard and fast rules.


# What would we do differently if we started over? 

This section is a result of our reflection on our journey and identifies 
some things we'd do differently and some other opportunities we'd like 
to pursue if we were starting over with the knowledge of the CQRS 
pattern and event sourcing that we now have. 

## Start with a solid infrastructure for messaging and persistence

We'd start with a solid messaging and persistence infrastructure. The 
approach we took, starting simple and building up the infrastructure as 
required meant that we built up technical debt during the journey. We 
also found that taking this approach meant that in some cases, the 
choices we made about the infrastructure affected the way we 
implemented the domain. 

> **JanaPersona:** From the perspective of the journey, if we had
> started with a solid infrastructure, we would have had time to tackle
> some of the more complex parts of the domain such as wait-listing.

Starting with a solid infrastructure would also enable us to 
start performance testing earlier. We would also do some more research 
into how other people do their performance testing on CQRS-based 
systems, and seek out performance benchmarks on other systems such as 
Jonathan Oliver's [EventStore][jolivereventstore]. 

One of the reasons we took the approach that we did was the advice we 
received from our advisors: "Don't worry about the infrastructure." 

## Leverage the capabilities of the infrastructure more

Starting with a solid infrastructure would also allow us to make more 
use of the capabilities of the infrastructure. For example, we use the 
identity of the message originator as the value of the session ID in 
Windows Azure Service Bus when we publish an event, but this is not 
always the best use of the session ID from the perspective of the parts 
of the system that process the event. 

As part of this, we'd also investigate how the infrastructure could 
support other special cases of eventual consistency such as timing 
consistency, monotonic consistency, "read my writes," and 
self-consistency. 

Another idea we'd like to explore is the use of the infrastructure to 
support migration between versions. Instead of treating migration in an 
ad-hoc manner for each version, we could consider using a message-based 
or real-time communication process to coordinate bringing the new 
version online. 

## Adopt a more systematic approach to implementing process managers

We began to implement our process manager very early in the journey and 
were still hardening it and ensuring that its behavior was idempotent in 
the last stage of the journey. Again, starting with some solid 
infrastructure support for process managers to make them more resilient 
would have helped us. However, if we were starting over, we'd also wait 
to implement a process manager until a later stage in the journey rather 
than diving straight in. 

We began implementing the **RegistrationProcessManager** class 
during the first stage in our journey. The initial implementation is 
described in Chapter 3, "[Orders and Registrations Bounded 
Context][j_chapter3]." We made changes to this process manager during 
every subsequent stage of our journey. 

## Partition the application differently

We would think more carefully at the start of the project about the tiering 
of the system. We found that the way we partitioned the application 
into web roles and worker roles as described in Chapter 4 "[Extending 
and Enhancing the Orders and Registrations Bounded Context][j_chapter4]," 
was not optimal, and in the last stage of the journey, Chapter 7 
"[Adding Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]" we made 
some major changes to this architecture as part of the performance 
optimization effort. 

For example, as a part of this reorganization in the last stage of the journey, we 
introduced synchronous command processing in the web application alongside the pre-existing 
asynchronous command processing.

## Organize the development team differently

The approach we took to learning about the CQRS pattern was to 
iterate &mdash; develop, go back, discuss, and then refactor. However, we may 
have learned more by having several developers work independently on the 
same feature and then compare the result; that might have uncovered a 
broader set of solutions and approaches. 

## Evaluate how appropriate the domain and the bounded contexts are for the CQRS pattern

We would like to start with a clearer set of heuristics, such as those 
outlined earlier in this chapter, to determine whether or not a 
particular bounded context will benefit from the CQRS pattern. We might 
have learned more if we had focused on a more complex area of the domain 
such as wait-listing instead of on the Orders and Registrations and 
Payments bounded contexts. 

## Plan for performance

We would address performance issues much earlier in the journey. In 
particular, we would: 

* Set clear performance goals ahead of time.
* Run performance tests much earlier in the journey.
* Use larger and more realistic loads.

We didn't do any performance testing until the last stage of our 
journey. For a detailed discussion of the issues we found and how we 
addressed them, see Chapter 7 "[Adding Resilience and Optimizing 
Performance][j_chapter7]." 

During the last stage of our journey, we introduced some partitioning on 
the Service Bus to improve the throughput of events. This partitioning 
is done based on the publisher of the event, so events published by one 
aggregate type go to one topic. We'd like to extend this to use multiple 
topics where we currently have one, perhaps partitioning based on a hash 
of the order ID in the message (this approach is often referred to as sharding). This would enable greater scale out for 
the application. 

## Think about the UI differently

We felt that the way our UI interacts with the write and read models, 
and how it handles eventual consistency worked well and met the business 
requirements. In particular, the way that the UI checks whether a 
reservation is likely to succeed and modifies its behavior accordingly 
and the way that the UI allows the user to continue entering data while 
it waits for the read model to be updated. For more details about how 
the current solution works, see the section "Optimizing the UI" in 
Chapter 7, "[Adding Resilience and Optimizing Performance][j_chapter7]."

We'd like to investigate other ways to avoid waiting in the UI unless 
it's absolutely necessary, perhaps by using browser push techniques. The 
UI in the current system still needs to wait, in some places, for 
asynchronous updates to take place against the read model. 

## Explore some additional benefits of event sourcing

We found during the third stage of our journey, described in Chapter 5, 
"[Preparing for the V1 Release][j_chapter5]", that modifying the Orders 
and Registrations bounded context to use event sourcing helped to 
simplify the implementation of this bounded context, in part because it 
was already using a large number of events. 

In the current journey, we didn't get a chance to explore the further 
promises of flexibility and the ability to mine past events for new 
business insights from event sourcing. However, we did ensure that the 
system persists copies of all events (not just those that are needed to 
rebuild the state of the aggregates) and commands to enable these types 
of scenarios in the future.

> the ability to mine past event streams for new business insights is
> easier to achieve with event sourcing or other technologies such as
> database transaction logs or the [StreamInsight][streaminsight]
> feature of SQL Server.

## Explore the issues associated with integrating bounded contexts 

In our V3 release, all of the bounded contexts are implemented by same 
core development team. We would like to investigate how easy it is, in 
practice, to integrate a bounded context implemented by a different 
development team with the existing system. 

This is a great opportunity for you to contribute to the learning 
experience: go ahead and implement another bounded context (see the 
outstanding stories in the [product backlog][backlog]), integrate it 
into the Contoso Conference Management System, and write another chapter 
of the journey describing your experiences.
