# Chapter 1: Our Domain: The Contoso Conference Management System 

_The starting point: Where have we come from, what are we taking, and who is coming with us?_

> "Without stones there is no arch," Marco Polo

This chapter introduces a fictitious company named Contoso. It describes 
Contoso's plans to launch the Contoso Conference Management System, a 
new online service that will enable other companies or individuals to 
organize and manage their own conferences and events. This chapter 
describes, at a high-level, some of the functional and non-functional 
requirements of the new system, and why Contoso wants to implement parts 
of it using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern and event sourcing (ES). As with any 
company considering this process, there are many issues to consider and 
challenges to be met, particularly because this is the first time 
Contoso has used both the CQRS pattern and event sourcing. The chapters 
that follow show, step by step, how Contoso designed and 
built its conference management application. 

This chapter also introduces a panel of fictional experts to comment 
on the development efforts. 

# The Contoso Corporation 

Contoso is a startup ISV company of approximately 20 employees that 
specializes in developing solutions using Microsoft technologies. 
The developers at Contoso are knowledgeable about various Microsoft 
products and technologies, including the .NET Framework, ASP.NET MVC, 
and Windows Azure. Some of the developers have previous experience
using the domain-driven design (DDD) approach, but none of them have 
used the CQRS pattern previously. 

The Conference Management System application is one of the first 
innovative online services that Contoso wants to take to market. As a 
startup, Contoso wants to develop and launch these services with a 
minimal investment in hardware and IT personnel. Contoso wants to be 
quick to market in order to start growing market share, and cannot 
afford the time to implement all of the planned functionality in the 
first releases. Therefore, it is important that the architecture it 
adopts can easily accommodate changes and enhancements with minimal 
impact on existing users of the system. Contoso has chosen to deploy the 
application on Windows Azure in order to take advantage of its ability 
to scale applications as demand grows. 

# Who is coming with us on the journey? 

As mentioned earlier, this guide and the accompanying RI describe a CQRS 
journey. A panel of experts will comment on our development efforts as we go. 
This panel includes a CQRS expert, a software architect, a developer, a 
domain expert, an IT Pro, and a business manager. They will all comment 
from their own perspectives.

# The Contoso Conference Management System 

This section describes the Contoso Conference Management System as the  
team envisaged it at the start of the journey. The team has not 
used the CQRS pattern before; therefore, the system that is delivered at 
the end of our journey may not match this description exactly because: 

* What we learn as we go may impact what we ultimately deliver.
* Because this is a learning journey, it is more difficult to estimate
  what we can achieve in the available time.

## Overview of the system

Contoso plans to build an online conference management system that will 
enable its customers to plan and manage conferences that are held 
at a physical location. The system will enable Contoso's customers to: 

* Manage the sale of different seat types for the conference.
* Create a conference and define characteristics of that conference.

The Contoso Conference Management System will be a multi-tenant, 
cloud-hosted application. Business Customers will need to register with 
the system before they can create and manage their conferences. 

### Selling seats for a conference

The business customer defines the number of seats available for the 
conference. The business customer may also specify events at a 
conference such as workshops, receptions, and premium sessions for which 
attendees must have a separate ticket. The business customer also 
defines how many seats are available for these events. 

The system manages the sale of seats to ensure that the conference and 
sub-events are not oversubscribed. This part of the system will also 
operate wait-lists so that if other Attendees cancel, their seats 
can be reallocated. 

The system will require that the names of the Attendees be associated 
with the purchased seats so that an on-site system can print badges for
the Attendees when they arrive at the conference. 

### Creating a conference

A Business Customer can create new conferences and manage information 
about the conference such as its name, description, and dates. The 
Business Customer can also make a conference visible on the Contoso 
Conference Management System website by publishing it, or hide it by 
unpublishing it. 

Additionally, the Business Customer defines the seat types and available 
quantity of each seat type for the conference. 

Contoso also plans to enable the Business Customer to specify the 
following characteristics of a conference: 

* Whether the paper submission process will require reviewers.
* What the fee structure for paying Contoso will be.
* Who key personnel, such as the program chair and the event planner,
  will be.

## Nonfunctional requirements

Contoso has two major nonfunctional requirements for its conference
management system-scalability and flexibility-and it hopes that the CQRS
pattern will help it meet them. 

### Scalability

The Conference Management System will be hosted in the cloud; one of 
the reasons Contoso chose a cloud platform was its scalability and 
potential for elastic scalability. 

Although cloud platforms such as Windows Azure enable you to scale 
applications by adding (or removing) role instances, you must still 
design your application to be scalable. By splitting responsibility for 
the application's read and write operations into separate objects, the 
CQRS pattern allows Contoso to split those operations into separate 
Windows Azure roles that can scale independently of each other. This 
recognizes the fact that for many applications, the number of read 
operations vastly exceeds the number of write operations. This gives 
Contoso the opportunity to scale the Conference Management System more 
efficiently, and make better use of the Windows Azure role instances 
it uses. 

### Flexibility

The market that the Contoso Conference Management System operates in is 
very competitive, and very fast moving. In order to compete, Contoso 
must be able to quickly and cost effectively adapt the Conference 
Management System to changes in the market. This requirement for 
flexibility breaks down into a number of related aspects: 

* Contoso must be able to evolve the system to meet new requirements 
  and to respond to changes in the market. 
  
> **BethPersona:** Contoso plans to compete by being quick to respond to
> changes in the market and to changing customer requirements. Contoso
> must be able to evolve the system quickly and painlessly.

* The system must be able to run multiple versions of its software 
  simultaneously in order to support customers who are in the middle of 
  a conference and who do not wish to upgrade to a new version 
  immediately. Other customers may wish to migrate their existing 
  conference data to a new version of the software as it becomes 
  available.
  
> **PoePersona:** This is a big challenge: keeping the system running
> for all our customers while we perform upgrades with no down time.

* Contoso intends the software to last for at least five years. It 
  must be able to accommodate significant changes over that period. 

* Contoso does not want the complexity of some parts of the system to 
  become a barrier to change. 

* Contoso would like to be able to use different developers for 
  different elements of the system, using cheaper developers for simpler 
  tasks and restricting its use of more expensive and experienced 
  developers to the more critical aspects of the system. 

> **GaryPersona:** There is some debate in the CQRS community 
> about whether, in practice, you can use different development teams 
> for different parts of the CQRS pattern implementation. 

# Beginning the journey

The next chapter is the start of our CQRS journey. It provides more 
information about the Contoso Conference Management System and describes 
some of the high-level parts of the system. Subsequent chapters describe 
the stages of the journey as Contoso implements the Conference Management 
System.
